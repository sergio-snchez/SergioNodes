"""
😺NKD Face Rig — edit a portrait's expression with a rig instead of sliders.

The node is deliberately thin. The expression lives in one hidden STRING that
the canvas editor writes, exactly like the spline nodes: the graph stores a rig
pose, the node turns it into an image. Everything interesting is in
`nkd_face_rig_axes` (what the handles mean) and `nkd_face_rig_engine` (the
LivePortrait pipeline).

The source cache is what makes the editor feel live. Preparing a photo — crop,
landmarks, the appearance volume — costs about a second; rendering a new
expression from it costs 25 ms. So the prepared source is kept per node and
reused by the preview route while the editor is open, and only rebuilt when the
photo or the crop actually changes.
