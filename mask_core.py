"""GPU mask morphology — the engine behind 😺NKD Mask Ops.

Everything here takes a `[B, H, W]` (or `[B, 1, H, W]`) float mask, runs on the
accelerator, and processes the whole batch in one go. That's the point: mask
work on video is a batch of frames, and the usual implementations (core's
GrowMask, KJ's GrowMaskWithBlur, scipy `binary_fill_holes`) loop frame by frame
on the CPU with an O(expand) chain of 3×3 kernels, which is where the seconds go.

Three ideas do the heavy lifting:

* **Separable flat morphology.** A square structuring element is separable, so
  dilation by radius r is a `1×(2r+1)` max-pool followed by a `(2r+1)×1` one:
  O(4r) work per pixel instead of O(4r²). Erosion is the same pass on the
  complement, so there is exactly one primitive.
* **Geodesic reconstruction** instead of open/close for the two ops where shape
  matters. Despeckle erodes to find which blobs survive and then regrows them to
  their *original* outline, so thin protrusions of the subject are not shaved
  off; hole filling is the same reconstruction run on the complement seeded from
  the border. One primitive, two features, no scipy and no CPU round-trip.
* **Time is just another pooling axis.** Reshaped to `[1, 1, T, H·W]`, a temporal
  max or moving average is a 2-D pool with a `(2n+1, 1)` kernel — the same
  kernels, no per-frame python.

    preserved ticks before it rise toward the cut, letting the model rework the end

    a callable in `downscale_ratio`, so evaluating it per frame gives the exact
