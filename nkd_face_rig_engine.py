"""
😺NKD Face Rig — the LivePortrait engine, on our own terms.

The engine is self-contained: LivePortrait is MIT, so we vendor it (see
`nkd_liveportrait/NOTICE`) and keep everything we add outside that directory.
No other custom node is imported or required.

Two deliberate departures from upstream:

* **An axis-aligned detector crop, not upstream's rotation-aligned one.** The
  contract of this node is that the same slider values keep giving the same
  picture as the expression workflows people already have, and the crop is
  where that is won or lost: the motion extractor's keypoints change with the
  framing it sees, so a differently aligned crop gives a visibly different
  render even with identical axes. `prepare` therefore uses the ecosystem's
  established geometry — YOLOv8 face bbox, square x crop_factor,
  axis-aligned, `int()` truncation and all — instead of upstream's
  rotation-aligned `crop_image`. InsightFace (upstream's detector) is out
  regardless: it carries a "non-commercial research purposes only" clause in
  LivePortrait's own LICENSE. When ultralytics is not installed the bbox
  comes from the self-bootstrapping landmark walk in `locate` — close, but
  not pixel-identical.
* **Our own weight loader.** Upstream's `load_model` calls `torch.load`
  without `weights_only`, which breaks on torch >= 2.6. Loading is a dozen
  lines, so we do it here rather than patch the vendor — a vendor you never
  edit is a vendor you can re-download instead of merge.

The split that makes the live preview possible: `PreparedSource` holds
everything that depends only on the photo (crop, landmarks, the appearance
volume f_s, the source keypoints), computed once. `render()` then does only
warp + decode, which the paper measures at 12.8 ms on a 4090. Dragging a
control re-runs `render()` and nothing else.
