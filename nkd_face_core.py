"""
The light half of the face pipeline: find a face, straighten it, mask it.

😺NKD Face Rig needs the whole LivePortrait stack — five checkpoints and a GPU —
because it *renders* a new expression. Cropping and masking need none of that:
one 10 MB ONNX landmark model answers where the face is, and everything after
that is geometry. So the landmark runner, the weight plumbing and the landmark
atlas live here, and `nkd_face_rig_engine` imports them. The dependency runs one
way only.

Two things are deliberately not models:

* **The alignment.** LivePortrait's `crop_image` already measures the roll from
  the eye-to-lip axis and folds it into the affine, so an upright crop is a
  keyword argument, not an algorithm. What comes back with it is `M_c2o`, which
  is the whole of the paste-back.
* **The mask.** With 203 landmarks on the face the outline is known, so the
  face mask is a filled polygon rather than a segmentation network. That is not
  only cheaper — it is the only route that stays commercially usable. The
  BiSeNet weights every other pack uses are trained on CelebAMask-HQ, which is
  licensed "for non-commercial research purposes only" and forbids exploiting
  "any portion of derived data". Same clause that kept InsightFace out of the
  rig.
