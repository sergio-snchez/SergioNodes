😺NKD Face Rig — the axis library.

LivePortrait's expression latent is a (1, 21, 3) tensor: 63 free numbers with no
published meaning. The paper only claims they "represent a kind of blendshapes";
nobody has published a mapping from them to anything a person can name.

What the community settled on instead is a de-facto set of twelve slider
directions — constants found by trial and error (`exp[0, 14, 1] += smile *
-0.02` and friends). They work, but they are fixed, several are not even
linear — the horizontal gaze uses different constants depending on its sign —
and left and right are welded together, which is why a proper one-eyed wink
has been a standing request for years.

This module turns that idea into something you can extend. An axis is a named
direction in R^63 plus whatever head rotation it drags along. Three consequences:

* **Left and right split, where the latent space actually allows it.** Eyes
  and brows separate cleanly — the wink request, finally honoured. The mouth
  does not, and the reason is measured rather than guessed — see the keypoint
  atlas below.
* **New axes are recorded, not coded.** `capture_axis` takes the latent of a
  neutral photo and of the same face pulling a face, and the difference is a
  new axis — a one-off comparison turned into a library entry you keep.
* **They can be made independent.** `orthogonalize` runs Gram-Schmidt so moving
  one control stops quietly undoing another. It is off by default, because an
  orthogonalised `smile` is no longer "smile", it is "smile minus whatever the
  earlier axes already explained".

Names are FACS action units because that is the vocabulary animators already
have, and because it lets a preset be checked against the published EMFACS
combinations rather than invented. But AU12 means nothing to most people, so
every axis also carries a plain-English `label`, and that is what the UI shows.

Pure numpy on purpose: no torch, no ComfyUI, so `tests/test_face_rig_axes.py`
runs anywhere in a second.

# "Left" is the left of the picture, which is the side the handle sits on. Two
# corrections to what is commonly assumed: **14 and 20 are not a left/right
# pair** — 14 is the right corner and 20 is the centre — and the real corner
# pair is 3/7, which carries an order of magnitude less weight in the legacy table
# than 14 does. That is why the mouth is not split by side here; see the
